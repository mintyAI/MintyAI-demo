    <h3 class="commonly-asked-questions">Commonky asked questions</h3>

<ul class="page-content">
  <li>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Why don't I use the normal ChatGPT instead?
    <br>
    <span class="answer">Answer:</span> Because normal AI answers are too broad or too specific, along with being complicated in general. But MintyAI solves both since it's trained to explain in simpler ways while trained to not go far from the curriculum.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Is MintyAI 100% accurate?
    <br>
    <span class="answer">Answer:</span> No, since at the end of the day it's still and AI model, but it's very accurate most if the time.
  </li>

  li>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Does this project gain any profit from being used?
    <br>
    <span class="answer">Answer:</span> No, it's completely free to use and we don't gain anything in the first place.
</li>

  li>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Does your project get updated every once in a while?
    <br>
    <span class="answer">Answer:</span> Yes! We're trying to improve it in ways that will make it more accurate, sleeker, and more comfortable to use in general. So every feedback counts. If you'd like to submit one go to mintyai.xyz/feedback.html .
