        <p class="dev-date">17/11/2025</p>
        <p>
           Added multiple tabs (webpages) for the website!
            I know its already expected, but hey, it took us less than a week!
            Along with that the webpage looks a lot cleaner now. But still planning to make it look nicer.

        <h2>🌐 Devlog #2 — Hosting Issues</h2>
        <p class="dev-date">17/11/2025</p>
        <p>
         When I first launched the website I first used Netlify to host since I thought the bandwidth would be enough and it was the most common option. Don't get me wrong, 
            Netlify offers plenty of bandwidth (100GB/month), but updating the GitHub without going through a hassle is hella anoying. So from now the server will be hosted using GitHub itself to make life way easier.
